## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on different features. We use a dataset containing various attributes such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, main road access, parking, and more. The model is trained using a Linear Regression algorithm and deployed with Streamlit to make predictions through a web application.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize the dataset and perform some basic statistics.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Analyze the correlation between different features.
- **Price Prediction**: Predict house prices using a trained model with user input.
- **Visualizations**: Display histograms, scatter plots, and model performance visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model and scaler.

## Data

The dataset contains various features related to houses and their prices. The following columns are present in the dataset:

- `area`: The area of the house in square feet.
- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms.
- `mainroad`: Whether the house is located near a main road (yes/no).
- `guestroom`: Whether the house has a guestroom (yes/no).
- `basement`: Whether the house has a basement (yes/no).
- `hotwaterheating`: Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no).
- `airconditioning`: Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no).
- `parking`: The number of parking spaces available.
- `furnishingstatus`: The furnishing status of the house (furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished).
- `price`: The price of the house (target variable).

## Model
![Image Description](media/model.png)

The model used in this project is a **Linear Regression** model. The dataset is preprocessed by scaling both the features and target variable using **StandardScaler**. The model is trained on the scaled dataset and saved using **Pickle** for future use.
